    What the hell is this JSON file?
    Okay. From what I've figured out, the initialisation of useState()
    requires you to precisely define the datatype that is going to be held within it:
    '' for strings
    {} for objects
    [] for arrays
    It also seems that whatever type is nested within the top layer also matters.
    In other words, nested types also need to be carefully defined during useState() init.
    In this case, the weather JSON file returned has a top layer of OBJECT, while its
    second layer is mixed. All but one attribute has the type OBJECT, while the
    attribute 'weather' has the type ARRAY.
    THIS seems to be causing ALL the problems with ReactJS.
    The workaround here is... let's see;
    WIP:
    to pick out all but one of the attributes with a useState({})
